# Homelab Guides
This repository is a set of guides around building and configuring a homelab.
I am hoping to both document my architechture, as well as provide useful guides and ideas for others 

You will find an index of the  guides below, have fun!

The Basic Build guide is where you want to start if you are playing with a home lab for the first time - You will need an old computer (pretty much anything will do) and 2 NICS (Ethernet ports)- you can use a USB ethernet adapter to get the second port for this build

My First Config was with an HP dl380 g7 rack server and ESXI
My Current Config uses a couple of old laptops and Proxmox

I reccomend taking a look at the Primary Technologies and Services for a quick peek at the tools used and services provided in the guides
