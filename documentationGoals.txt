- every how-to along the way
- no interconnected guides
    - just explain end config, making sure all steps are documented
- create some tutorials 
    - All primary services in one host example

Explanation docs:
    - ACME & DNS validation
    - vpn & split tunnel
    - WHYireguard

        x ____pfsense on net appliance (via console cable)____

    - DNS based ACME certs
        x ____namecom api key____
        x ____pfsense____
        - traefik
        x ____proxmox____
        - acme.sh for scripts / custom tools
    - virtualization
        - proxmox vm (easy, link to guide)
        - Ubuntu docker environment

        - homeauto vm (containerize after other docs built)
    - service chart depicting where each service is running & net interactions
    - Network Architecture
        - vlans with appropriate firewall rules:
            - untrusted wifi (iot net)
            - workstations
            - trusted wifi ( no direct server access)
            - hypervisor / vm 
            - ?
        - charts for the above
            - logical networks
            - subnets & dhcp scopes
            - firewall interactions
