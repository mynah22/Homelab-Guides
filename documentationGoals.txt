things I want to document for the rebuild. Some may already be written, but this pass should include a recheck of those items. 

- every how-to along the way
- no interconnected guides
    - just explain end config, making sure all steps are documented
- create some tutorials 
    - All primary services in one host example
    - ubuntu docker host with traefik
    - dynamic dns options on pfsense 
Explanation docs:
    - ACME & DNS validation
    - vpn & split tunnel
    - WHYireguard

    - DNS based ACME certs
        x ____namecom api key____
        x ____pfsense____
        x ____proxmox____
        - traefik
        - acme.sh for scripts / custom tools
    - virtualization
        - proxmox vm (easy, link to guide)

            - hypervisor / vm 
            - ?
        - charts for the above
            - logical networks
